# sakai-hacks

These are small scripts to make my life with University of Delaware's sakai system easier.

##Combine-answers

Combines students' submissions for a given assignment into a textfile, stripped from students' name. 

It takes the folder of all students' submissions that can be downloaded from sakai, and outputs a textfile with only the answers.
